## Christmas Sweater Day

The Christmas jumper is more than just kitsch - it's a symbol of solidarity that has helped raise £40 million for children in need since 2012. In Poland, we celebrate this holiday in our own way: in schools, offices, with...

## Caddis Day

Contrary to appearances, it is not a celebration of tasty baked goods, but of... aquatic insects. Caddisflies are legally protected and play an important role in the biomonitoring process. The originator of the holiday is Lech Pietrzak, who proposed Caddis Day on Radio Three in 2002. The initiative gained recognition and quickly turned into an annual event.
