## World Introvert Day

For many people, a relaxing evening in an armchair with a book and a cup of delicious, hot tea is a nice break from their busy lifestyle. However, there are people who spend their time this way almost every day and feel great about it! Introverts, because we are talking about them, celebrate their day on January 2. It's worth making them happy on this occasion and giving them a book or a large mug of tea. However, the best gift will be to understand their needs and respect their unique disposition.
